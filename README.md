# TODO APP

For this full-stack code challenge you will need to develop the following features:

Backend:

- CRUD functionality, follow REST standard, there is no need for a DB, use the `todos` variable instead
- For Create, Update, and Delete, the request must have the correct `Api-Key` header, if not return the correct HTTP status

Frontend:

- Render the todo list
- Create todo, after one todo is added make sure to reset the input
- Toggle todo status and update the app state
- Delete todo and update the app state

Extra points:

- Add request validation
- Filter todos by status
- Ability to search for todos
- Ability to export todos to a CSV file

To start the react and express apps run
`npm run dev`
